# BERT_seq_classification
### Using pretrained BERT to perform inference for sentence classification.
This repo presents steps to generate label predictions from sentence inputs in Pytorch. This was done after training a BERT model according to the tutorial by [huggingface](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples) and the model is saved in a directory. The huggingface repo does not currently have a `predict` module or Class but it does offer an option for `evaluation` as the model is being trained.
